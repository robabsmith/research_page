# Research page

This is a simple GitBook with just a small selection of the current and recent research projects that I have been working on with colleagues here at Aalborg University Business School.

The vast majority of this work never ends up published, and I figured that it might be put to better use sharing it with the research community.

Everything you see on this page is generated using RMarkdown - and as far as possible, sources data directly from the sources needed for the analysis. One major exception is that the SFC model in the second section is solved using Eviews. The output of the model is, which is a simple `.csv` file is processed by the RMD file that creates the chapter - so you can see how the variable names are de-composed and then used as lookup references to generate the document.

The plots, figures and all numerical data included in the text of the chapter are also automated - so that if there is a change to the model, the code finds the correct figures and modifies them in the document.

This is pretty simple to do - but it requires a little forward thinking when organising the names of variables.

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
