# Introduction

Hi, my name is Robert Smith, and I am based at the [Aalborg University Business School](https://www.business.aau.dk) (2021), this page is just a collection of some of the more recent research that I have been doing with colleagues.

This site is generated using RMarkdown, and it is a place to share ideas for the visual representation of research.

My primary area of research is in macroeconomics, with a focus on Stock-Flow consistent models. These models are relatively large and complex, and visual presentation of the details of these models is normally pretty challenging.

Any comments and suggestions for new ways to communicate / represent material are always welcome.

## Part 2

Is an HTML rendition of the final chapter of my PhD - apart from a few minor modifications to the plotting code, everything you see in that section is generated in RMD, and all of the back-end code is available for your to browse / use. As long as you respect the licence terms.

## Part 3 

Is a collection of custom additions to the `ggplot2` environment (also used in the SFC model chapter) that might make your life easier, if you want to move your legends into a plot, change the angle of the text in the axes etc. It also includes a few interactive plots using the `plotly` environment.

More hopefully to follow soon.
